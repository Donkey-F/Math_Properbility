# Welcome!  
  
Firstly, I make a stupid mistake while naming my repository...Just ignore it :)  
  
This is about the probability course.  
I tend to use Matlib or Python to simulate some theorems when I want to have some deeper understanding on these theorems.  
If they are helpful to you, I will be very happy :)  
  
If you have any question or great idea, please please contact me as soon as possilbe!

Enjoy yourself in the mathematical world!

    (2)Ignore the folder"CLT", it will be deleted soon(there is something wrong with its content,  
       the final version is in the /Central_limit_theorem/CLT
