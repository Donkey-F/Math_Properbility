# Welcome!  

This is about the probability course.  
I tend to use Matlib or Python to simulate some theorem when I want to have some deeper understanding or them.  
If they are helpful to you, I will be very happy :)  
  
If you have any question or great idea, please please contact me as soon as possible!!!  
My personal e-mail address: 16zfdeng5@stu.edu.cn  
Enjoy here :)
