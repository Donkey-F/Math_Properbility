# Central-limit theorem simulating using Matlab

You can check the CLT.html firstly in the path: ./CLT/html/CLT.html, download the file and open it with your browser.    
The source code is CLT.m, you can open it with Matlab.  
Again, the folder Math_Properbility/CLT will be deleted in the future, current folder contains the final version of the simulating of  
central limit theorem.
