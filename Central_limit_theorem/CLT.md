# Central-limit theorem simulating using Matlib

You can check the CLT.html firstly in the direction /CLT, it is much more clear.  
The source code is CLT.m, you can open it with Matlib.  
I mistakenly created this file...Sorry :(  
You can check the Math_Probability/CLT for more detail  
  
If there is any question or great idea, please contact me :)
